Hi! I’m Pan-Yang Su (蘇磐洋), an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" title="Title"> National Taiwan University Department of Electrical Engineering (NTUEE)</a>. My research interests are in game theory, algorithm, optimization, and quantum information theory. I am currently working on mechanism design for 5G networks and quantum game theory.
